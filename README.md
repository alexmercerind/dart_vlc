## Documentation

#### Initialize the library

```dart
void main() {
  DartVLC.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

#### Create a new player instance.
```dart
Player player = Player(id: 69420);
```

#### Create a media for playback.
```dart
Media media0 = Media.file(
  File('C:/music.mp3')
);

Media media1 = Media.network(
  'https://www.example.com/music.aac'
);
```

#### Create a list of medias using playlist.
```dart
Playlist playlist = new Playlist(
  medias: [
    Media.file(File('C:/music.mp3')),
    Media.file(File('C:/audio.mp3')),
    Media.network('https://www.example.com/music.aac'),
  ],
);
```

#### Open a media or playlist into a player.

```dart
player.open(
  Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
  autoStart: true, // default
);
```

```dart
player.open(
  Playlist(
    medias: [
      Media.file(new File('C:/music0.mp3')),
      Media.file(new File('C:/music1.mp3')),
      Media.file(new File('C:/music2.mp3')),
    ],
  ),
  autoStart: false,
);
```

#### Control playback.
```dart
player.play();

player.seek(Duration(seconds: 30));

player.pause();

player.playOrPause();

player.stop();
```

#### Traverse through the playlist.
```dart
player.next();

player.back();

player.jump(10);
```

#### Manipulate an already playing playlist.
```dart
player.add(
  Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
);

player.remove(4);

player.insert(
  2,
  Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
);

player.move(0, 4);
```

#### Set playback volume & rate.
```dart
player.setVolume(0.5);

player.setRate(1.25);
```

#### Get & change playback device.
```dart
List<Device> devices = Devices.all;

player.setDevice(
  devices[0],
);
```

#### Show the video inside widget tree.

Instanciate `Player` as follows.
```dart
Player player = Player(
  id: 69420,
  videoWidth: 480,
  videoHeight: 320,
);
```
Show `Video` in the `Widget` tree.
```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Video(
        playerId: 69420,
        height: 1920.0,
        width: 1080.0,
        scale: 1.0, // default
        showControls: false, // default
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Thanks to [@tomassasovsky](https://github.com/tomassasovsky) for adding visual controls to `Video` widget.

#### Retrieve metadata of media.
```dart
Media media = Media.network(
  'https://www.example.com/media.mp3',
  parse: true,
  timeout: Duration(seconds: 10),
);

Map<String, String> metas = media.metas;
```

#### Listen to playback events.

(Same can be retrieved directly from `Player` instance without having to rely on stream).

```dart
player.currentStream.listen((CurrentState state) {
  state.index;
  state.media;
  state.medias;
  state.isPlaylist;
});
```

```dart
player.positionStream.listen((PositionState state) {
  state.position;
  state.duration;
});
```

```dart
player.playbackStream.listen((PlaybackState state) {
  state.isPlaying;
  state.isSeekable;
  state.isCompleted;
});
```

```dart
player.generalStream.listen((GeneralState state) {
  state.volume;
  state.rate;
});
```

#### Set an equalizer.

Create using preset.

```dart
Equalizer equalizer = Equalizer.createMode(EqualizerMode.party);
player.setEqualizer(equalizer);
```

Create custom equalizer.

```dart
Equalizer equalizer = Equalizer.createEmpty();
equalizer.setPreAmp(10.0);
equalizer.setBandAmp(31.25, -10.0);
equalizer.setBandAmp(100.0, -10.0);
player.setEqualizer(equalizer);
```

Get equalizer state.

```dart
equalizer.preAmp;
equalizer.bandAmps;
```

#### Broadcast a media.

Broadcasting to localhost.

```dart
Broadcast broadcast = Broadcast.create(
  id: 0,
  media: Media.file(File('C:/video.mp4')),
  configuration: BroadcastConfiguration(
    access: 'http',
    mux: 'mpeg1',
    dst: '127.0.0.1:8080',
    vcodec: 'mp1v',
    vb: 1024,
    acodec: 'mpga',
    ab: 128,
  ),
);
broadcast.start();
```

Dispose the `Broadcast` instance to release resources.
```dart
broadcast.dispose();
```

#### Record a media.

Thanks to [@DomingoMG](https://github.com/DomingoMG) for adding `Record` and `Chromecast` classes.

```dart
Record record = Record.create(
  id: 205, 
  media: Media.network('https://www.example.com/streaming-media.MP3'), 
  pathFile: '/home/alexmercerind/recording.MP3',
);
record.start();
```

**NOTE:** For using this plugin on Linux, you must have [VLC](https://www.videolan.org) & [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html) installed. 
On debian based distros, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install vlc
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
```
On Fedora, enable RPMFusion repositories first:

```bash
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```
Then run:

```bash
sudo dnf install vlc
```
```bash
sudo dnf install vlc-devel
```

## Workings
The repository contains a [C++ wrapper](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/dartvlc) based on libVLC++. This makes handling of events and controls a lot easier & has additional features in it.
I preferred to do majority of handling in C++ itself, thus Dart code is minimal & very slight mapping to it.

This project might seem like a Flutter plugin, but it is based on FFI instead. [Here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/ffi) are the FFI bindings to [C++ wrapper](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/dartvlc), which are shared by all platforms & same can be used in Dart CLI apps aswell.

## Contributions

The code in the project is nicely arranged (I guess), I have added comments wherever I felt necessary.

Contributions to the project are open, it will be appreciated if you discuss the bug-fix/feature-addition in the issues first.

## Vision

There aren't any media (audio or video) playback libraries for Flutter or Dart on Windows/Linux yet. So, this project is all about that.
As one might be already aware, VLC is one of the best media playback tools out there.

So, now you can use it to play audio or video files from Flutter or Dart apps.

Support for other platforms is also under progress.
